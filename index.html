        <p>Hi, I'm Adriana!</p>
        <p>I‚Äôm a currently a Business Development Engineer at Keysight Technologies. I made this (very boring) website as my first side project and my future portfolio. I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a bachelors in Industrial Engineering and I‚Äôm currently taking Erik Kennedy‚Äôs Learn UI Design course.</p>

          <p><b>School:</b> I went to the University of Central Florida from 2017 to 2021. I studied Industrial Engineering with minors in Computer Science and Math. Outside of classes, I was a part of Theta Tau (engineering fraternity), SHPE, SWE, and frequented The Knights Pub for happy hour deals.</p>

          <p><b>Fun:</b> Outside of work, I've fallen victim to endless TikTok scrolling. I also love to travel, eat good food, and drink craft beer. Since moving to Colorado, I've started spending more time outside and hiking (very slowly). I commit to the gym in waves, but never in the winter, and I spend a lot of time on Spotify (40,619 minutes in 2022 to be exact).</p>
